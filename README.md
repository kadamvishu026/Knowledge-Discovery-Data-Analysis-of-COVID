Knowledge Discovery using Data Analysis of COVID

This project will analyze the COVID Dataset to understand which age group is mostly affected due to COVID (Knowledge Discovery).
The data that will be studied has been gathered over a period of time.
In this project, we performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset features to determine how they are spread.
We analyzed each variable to check if data is cleaned and normally distributed.
We cleaned the data and removed NA values. Next, create an age dictionary and split age group data then apply Algorithms Like SVM, LR and PR.
ultimately, in the result, we got a model with accuracy, so (R2 score) LR We obtained value and 803.04 in PR (RMSE) values
The outcomes of the proposed research show that Polynomial Regression is better than the other supervised learning methods.

The knowledge discovery depends on the affected number of age wise deflection

scope:
The goal of this Knowledge Discovery utilising Data Analysis of COVID study is to identify the
age group that COVID-19 affects most severely.
The studies' results showed that COVID-19 had an impact on people in the young adult and
elderly age groups.
So, in the future, people between the ages of 30 and 50 who are most affected by the COVID-19
should take more precaution.
